BaggedTrees.m
This is an implementation of Bagging decision trees with 
the out-of-bag error computed. The bagged ensembles are generated
by using matlab's inbuilt fitctree function, which learns 
decision trees using CART algorithm.

Preprocessing.m adultTest.m
A hypothesis learned by using bagged decision trees on the 
training data set. Classification error computed on the 
test data set.
